# Snakemake

We recommend trying out Snakemake as a replacement for GNU Make for managing workflows with several parts, such as:

* download raw data
* process raw data into clean data
* divide dataset into train and test
* train models
* * train model A
* * train model B
* make result figure (using results from A and B)

Using snakemake, you can easily manage data science workflows in a Python-like syntax.
