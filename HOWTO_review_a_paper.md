Good general practice:

First, write the paper summary (what did they do?). 

Next, force yourself to list out 3 strengths as well as 3 weaknesses. Try to look at the *balance* between the two.

Next, write out detailed comments on the weaknesses.

Next, write your overall top-level summary. Should this be accepted? Would you recommend this paper to a colleague?

Finally, read over the whole review... are you being fair? Is most of the review addressing the truly important strengths/weaknesses?
