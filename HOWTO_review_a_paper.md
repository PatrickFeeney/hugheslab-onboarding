# Golden rule

** Review unto others, as you would like your own papers to be reviewed. **

Reviews can be needlessly harsh. Remember [Dennett's 4 rules for successful critical feedback](https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/03/28/daniel-dennett-rapoport-rules-criticism/):

* You should attempt to re-express your target’s position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, “Thanks, I wish I’d thought of putting it that way.
* You should list any points of agreement (especially if they are not matters of general or widespread agreement).
* You should mention anything you have learned from your target.
* Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal or criticism.
