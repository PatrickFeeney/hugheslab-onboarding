## Research Prospectus outline for HughesLab

Generally, I think of the "minimum requirement" for a PhD to be 3 high-profile papers that make fundamental contributions toward an over-arching scientific/engineering goal.

So I think of the Prospectus as a ~1 page document (citations can spill over onto page 2) that establishes:
- the unifying theme (paragraph 1)
- detailed contributions for the 3 papers (paragraph 2-4)

Parag 1: Research Question.
- What is the fundamental contribution of your thesis?
- What problem is unsolved by current methods?
- Why is it tough or unsolved?
- What has been tried and why didn’t it work?
- What are you doing differently (at a high level)?

Parag 2: Progress thus far [usually, a summary of 1+ papers you've already presented, usually most already done for quals]
- What have you done previously in this space?
- Why does it matter? How does this fit into your overall vision?

Parag 3: Plan for Project 1. 
- What is the goal of the next paper you’ll write? 
- What contribution will it make?
- Why does it matter? How does this fit into your overall vision?

Parag 4: Plan for Project 2.
- What is the plan for the next paper after Project 1? (same questions as Parag 3)

References
- Usually I expect to see ~10 citations, which makes the document feel "heavy enough". Too few citations shows limited engagement, too many shows too much detail.

## LIVING DOCUMENT

THis is a living document, you should probably make some edits every 3-6 months or so, every time a new result is achieved.

At the end of your phd, you can use this 4 paragraph structure as the "Abstract" of your PhD thesis.

Here's some example abstracts of finalized PhD dissertations that follow (somewhat) this 4 paragraph structure.
