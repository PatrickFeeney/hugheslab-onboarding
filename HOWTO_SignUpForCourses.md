Tufts has a complicated system of possible courses for you to get credit for your research time.

# Overall "rules"

Worth remembering the "rules" and "expectations"

* 1) Students may EITHER be enrolled in 9 SHUs OR be enrolled in 6 SHUs and either TAship or RAship in order to be considered “full time.” 6 SHUs is “enough” for most of our students.
    
* 2) When our full time supported Ph.D. students register for courses, our presumption should be that they will register for 6-9 SHUs — if we expect them to graduate quickly (a good presumption!), we veer toward the 9SHUs.   So if a student is taking Comp 105 (for 5 SHUs) and Comp 160 (with 4 SHUs), then they *definitely* do *not* register for Comp 297-298 in that semester.   If the student is taking just Comp 105 (for 5 SHUs), may register for Comp 297 (in the fall) or Comp 298 (in the spring) for up to 4 SHUs, whereas if the student is taking two 3-SHU Comp 150 courses, may register for up to 3 Comp 297/298 SHUs.

* 3) Completion of the Ph.D. is considered to be 60 SHUs post-Master’s, where *only 6 SHUs are required to be in standard courses*. The remainder of those SHUs will be in COMP 297/298 Graduate Research credits.

* 4) The CS Department Policy, ratified by the SOE Grad Dean is that no grades are given for Comp 297/298 Graduate Research credits until such time as the student has successfully passed the Final Public Dissertation Defense — that is when we know whether the research conducted by the student was “successful”. We used to not record any grade at all, but starting two years ago, the registrar insists that we enter a grade of “Y”.   A “Y” indicates that the work is still in progress, BUT IT WAS EXPECTED TO BE SO.   This is very different from an “Incomplete” which suggests that the student was in someway deficient in focus or execution and somehow didn’t get things done on time.   A “Y” means that by design, there is not yet a grade.
    
# Scenarios

## For 2nd year students who are working toward MS degree

> Do a COMP 293 “Master’s Project”, also counting towards the degree

## For students preparing for Quals in the upcoming semester or who just need a credit to "count" toward the MS

> If you want "course credit" for preparing for quals (helps count toward an MS degree at Tufts): We can do a COMP 193-IND independent study
	But if the student already has an MS from another institution, you don't need this course as a way of counting towards a magic 10 courses for the MS + 2 courses post-MS.

## For 2nd year or later phd students who already have an MS from another institution (and don't want an MS CS from Tufts along way to PhD)

> Do COMP 297/298. This says you are working on phd-level research that is ongoing and gives you the right amount of credit to be full-time. (See above, you'll get a grade of 'Y' in these courses until you finish up your phd).

## For 1st year students admitted to the PhD program without an MS in a field close to CS

> Register for COMP 406-RA. If a student is an RA, then doing COMP 406-RA means they are “recorded” as doing 20 hrs/week of research and thus at full-time status if they have 6 SHUs of other coursework. It is fine in the first semester(s) to take just 2 standard courses for full-load plus this course to achieve full-time status.
