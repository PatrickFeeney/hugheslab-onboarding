A common component of an application to a full-time research position (faculty job, postdoc, or industry research job) is a *research statement*

For example, the ad for faculty jobs at Tufts asks for a "statement describing your current and planned research"

This brief doc, written in 2024, is intended to put together some nice resources for doing this, specifically for *faculty* positions at R1 universities like Tufts

Goal of this document:

* Quality: Decide if you are "above the bar" (at least 3 papers of high quality where you made primary aka first-author contributions)
* Fit: Help readers assess how you'll fit into their institution (who would you collaborate with?)
* Vision: Where will you go in 5 years? Will be competitive in attracting grad students and turning them into PhDs? Grant applications?

### Know your audience

Who is reading this document? Existing faculty at the institution, who have already ready 20+ other statements that same day. 

* Make it easy to skim! Use headings and bold topic phrases and key sentences, but don't go crazy.
* Articulate a clear niche for yourself (not too general, not too specific)
* Keep it short and simple (have a 2 page version and a 3 page version ready to go).

### Reflect your brand

Want this research statement to have synergy with your other statements and CV, and make clear what skills + interests you have.

See MIT EECS resources on branding: <https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/eecs/commkit/faculty-application/>

Be more narrow than "AI for X" or "computer vision", but not about one project.

### Write early and Get feedback early!

It's never too early to start draft this document. Ideally it grows out of your research prospectus!

MCH is happy to give feedback on this at any time.

Highly recommend getting at least 1-2 other faculty members to give feedback (one in your area, one outside of it to see how it comes across to outsiders)
