A common component of an application to a full-time research position (faculty job, postdoc, or industry research job) is a *research statement*

For example, the ad for faculty jobs at Tufts asks for a "statement describing your current and planned research"

This brief doc, written in 2024, is intended to put together some nice resources for doing this, specifically for *faculty* positions at R1 universities like Tufts

Goal of this document:

* Quality: Decide if you are "above the bar" (at least 3 papers of high quality where you made primary aka first-author contributions)
* Fit: Help readers assess how you'll fit into their institution (who would you collaborate with?)
* Vision: Where will you go in 5 years? Will be competitive in attracting grad students and turning them into PhDs? Grant applications?

### Know your audience

Who is reading this document? Existing faculty at the institution, who have already ready 20+ other statements that same day. 

* Make it easy to skim! Use headings and bold topic phrases and key sentences, but don't go crazy.
* Articulate a clear niche for yourself (not too general, not too specific)
* Keep it short and simple (have a 2 page version and a 3 page version ready to go).
