We have 3 events that happen *every week* I want to highlight. These start next week!

1. Lightning chats
------------------
3 days a week for 20 minutes, where an assigned presenter talks about a cool idea.
For fall, we'll do 11:40-12:00pm ET on M, W, and Th. All over zoom.

Basically, a way to make sure weâ€™re all reading widely and talking regularly about the fun and exciting and free-thinking part of research, not just focused on one narrow project.
You should plan to attend every time, unless you have class or something else significant.

Assigned schedule is here:
